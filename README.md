# Scrabble
Interactive Scrabble word game developed in Java Swing to provide an intuitive GUI and online word API. Developed using Java Swing.


Interactive Scrabble word game developed in Java Swing to provide an intuitive GUI to play the game. Uses a simple and easy to understand user interface comprised of panels, buttons, labels, and frames. With the use of the WordNik online word API and HTTP requests the program is able to make calls and pull JSON data to have an endless supply of legal scrabble words. 


Few important notes:

1. If the full UI does not fit on your screen zoom out until it fits the full frame 
2. Enter user input with respect to value types and restrictions given in instrucions (I didn't add catch statements yet)
3. Normally scrabble is played until all 100 tiles are gone, so to reduce the time it takes to play just reduce the value of tilesRemaining in the Player.java file
4. You will not need the terminal open at all so you can maximize the GUI window
